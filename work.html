                <h2>MyReverse Shell<i>.py</i></h2>
                <p>My cybersecurity project involves the implementation of a reverse shell inspired by Command and Control (C2) frameworks. In this context, a target system connects back to a server hosted on my Raspberry Pi. This configuration allows non-technical users to access the victim device through the connection established by the Raspberry Pi server. After that, I have access to the victim's webcam, microphone, files... It's important to note that such projects should be approached responsibly, strictly for educational purposes, and in adherence to ethical guidelines.</p>

                <h2>Omniscient<i>.js</i></h2>
                <p>My OSINT project involves the development of a scraping tool designed to collect all messages from an individual on a public Discord server. Subsequently, these messages are fed into a language model to generate a profile or summary of the person. This tool aims to facilitate Open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering by extracting valuable insights from publicly available Discord conversations. It is essential to use such tools responsibly, adhering to legal and ethical considerations and respecting privacy.</p>

                <h2>Neo's Fishing Rod<i>.py</i></h2>
                <p>My cybersecurity project for school is an automated phishing tool hosted on my Raspberry Pi and connected to a MariaDB database. This tool focuses on simulating phishing scenarios in an automated manner through smtp protocol, providing users with a safe environment to recognize and respond to potential threats. I did not actually attempt phishing or collect sensitive information.</p>

                <h2>SocialBot<i>.py</i></h2>
                <p>My Discord bot project is a playful simulation inspired by the concept of Chinese social credit systems. Created for entertainment purposes among friends, the bot incorporates statistics, utilizes a MariaDB database hosted on a Raspberry Pi, and employs multithreading in Python with SQL commands.</p>

                <h2>RouteurS<i>.cpp</i></h2>
                <p>My C++ project involves creating a nearby router detector, an application designed to identify routers in close proximity by collecting information such as MAC address, BSSID, SSID, and signal strength. This educational or professional project aims to illustrate wireless network detection concepts, particularly for applications like Wi-Fi coverage mapping.</p>

                <h2>MagicMephist0<i>.ue5</i></h2>
                <p>I'm currently working on an isometric-view game using Unreal Engine. The project includes creating custom textures for a unique visual style. It's a work in progress, with ongoing development to enhance the gaming experience.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Motion<i>.py</i></h2>
                <p>My project involves creating a hands-free drawing tool using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Users can draw on a Turtle canvas remotely, simply by using hand gestures, akin to a Kinect-style interaction. The project leverages computer vision and hand-tracking technologies to enable an intuitive and interactive drawing experience without the need for physical input devices.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Hardware<i>.fun</i></h2>
                <p>In my electronic projects, I designed a 3-bit memory using simple transistors. Additionally, I incorporated Arduino and Raspberry Pi to establish communication with APIs, such as Météo France, for data retrieval. I also moved servo motors just with my mouse.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>RSA<i>.py</i></h2>
                <p>My project involved the step-by-step implementation of asymmetric RSA encryption, including the mathematical intricacies. I successfully executed each stage, demonstrating the process of key generation, encryption, and decryption. This project showcases a comprehensive understanding of RSA encryption, a fundamental concept in cybersecurity, and emphasizes the ability to translate mathematical principles into practical applications.</p>
